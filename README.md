# jupyterlab_practice

In this exercise, we further explored JupyterLab.

To begin with we created a new GitHub repo to work in. 
We also created a branch on which to perform all our changes. This was good additional practice.

The first part of the assignment looked at the different types of files we can open, edit, and play around with in JupyterLab. There was also an emphasized placed on the different types of cells there can be: code vs. markdown.

Here, we practiced using different markdown syntax and visualizing the outcome. This included LaTex formulas for mathematical equations. 

In addition, we used the multiple view capabilities to look at different parts of the same notebook. As well as different files.

Throughout the entire exercise, we further improved our usage and understanding of the command line, commits, and working with GitHub.
